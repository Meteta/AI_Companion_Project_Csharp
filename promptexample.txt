Europa was colonized in the late 2400s.

Factions:
- The Europa Coalition: The Coalition began as a trade agreement between two prominent settlements roughly a century before the events of 2500 AD, at a time when exonationalism, or the belief that Europa was no mere colony but an independent world, was coming about and gaining popularity. The leaders of these pro-Europan settlements pooled their resources and hired paramilitary groups to defend their investments and trade routes, funneling currency and power to where they needed them the most. The Coalition expanded their reach, allying with friendly settlements and taking over other ones which were not equally keen on joining. Soon enough, they controlled most of the important trade routes and industry on Europa and were well on their way to becoming the de facto government of the moon. Their goal: to see Europa come into its own, without Earth’s oversight.
- The Jovian Separatists: Originally a political party called the Jovian People’s Movement. The JPM was formed around the same time as the Coalition, and was in direct opposition to the political ideals and methods of their rival. The JPM wanted to build a democratic society on Europa through nonviolent means and model it after earlier civilizations on Earth. The Movement amassed a large number of supporters and became a noteworthy challenger to the Coalition in the general election of Europa. A couple of weeks before the election was going to take place, however, there was a nuclear disaster in the colony of Tormsdale, the unofficial headquarters of the JPM and the independent colonies. The reactor meltdown and ensuing explosion dealt a devastating blow to the Movement, with many of their supporters among the deceased. Despite this tragedy, the election was not rescheduled, and the crippled JPM could not gather enough votes to overtake the Coalition. The Tormsdale incident was declared an accident, but the timing raised suspicion among the JPM’s ranks, with many believing the Coalition had a hand in it. Tensions boiled over and attacks were made against Coalition submarines and outposts. Even though the leaders of the JPM denounced the acts of violence, the party was declared a terrorist organization. Not long after, the JPM was no more and the Jovian Separatists rose from its remains.
- Clowns: A cult of clowns that worship the Honkmother. They attempt to bring happyness to Europa, at any cost, and end up sometimes taking their jokes and pranks too far.
- Church of the Husk: A cult of people who believe the future of humanity lies in the husk infection. They will regularly attempt to infect themselves or gain Husk Symbiosis through genetic engineering.



Husk Infection: 
The infection can be divided in four stages: dormant, active, transformed, and final.
- The dormant stage of the infection (up to 50 strength) has no adverse side effects. The affliction will not be shown on the health-interface until the infection reaches 40 strength. A player using a Health Scanner HUD can detect the infection once it reaches 20 strength.
- The active stage (50-75 strength) will add a 30% speech impediment to affected humans. This will garble radio-communications (similar to the effects of approaching the maximum communications range), and reduce the range of local (i.e. non-headset) chat by 30%.
- The transformed stage of the infection (75-100 strength) has both negative and positive effects: A stinger-like appendage will grow out of the character's throat which can be used to attack with F and spread the infection to other characters or creatures, slightly healing the host for every successful attack. It also add a 100% speech impediment, completely preventing any communication – neither the command-interface, nor text-chat, nor voice-chat will work. In this stage, the character will also develop an immunity to pressure everywhere, along with the ability to breathe underwater, allowing affected humans to freely swim in the Europan ocean without a Diving Suit icon.png Diving Suit. Any character that dies during this stage will 'revive' as a husk. During the transformed stage, Husks and other husked creatures will not attack unless provoked. 'Provocation' includes attacking the creature, or wearing/using any 'provocative' items (such as any of the Diving Suits, active Flashlights, Underwater Scooters, Handheld Sonars, Handheld Sonars, both types of Flares, Glowsticks, Fire Extinguishers, or discharging a ranged weapon in their vicinity). Removing the source of provocation will return the Husk to a passive state after a few seconds.
Note that attacking a husk will make them permanently hostile.
- The final stage (at 100 strength) will make the afflicted character have seizures while slowly dying of internal damage, rising back from the dead as an NPC Husk or Husked Crawler. Husks do not revive a second time after being killed. It is not possible to treat a character with Calyxanide at the final stage, but it is possible to cure them at a Medical Clinic in an outpost.

Afflictions:
- Watchers Gaze: In humans causes visual hallucinations, slows down movement speed and induces nausia.

Items in Europa:

Alien Creatures in Europa:
Pets:
- Cthulhu (Pet): A small winged creature resembling the lovecraftian creature Cthulhu. It can be kept as a pet and helps defend its owner when they are attacked. It eats Pet Food Type 2. 
- Orange Boy (Pet): A small creature resembling an Armadillo and a Crab that can be kept as a pet. It eats Pet Food Type 3.
- Peanut (Pet): A small slug like creature with a big head and a mediocre shell on its back. It can be kept as a pet. It eats Pet Food Type 1.
- Psilotoad (Pet): A small creature with a face and skin tone similar to that of a toad, however appears to be a slug with fungus growing from it. It can be kept as a pet and eats Pet Food Type 2

Small Creatures:
- Humans
- Crawlers: The Crawler is a creature somewhat resembling merfolk, but twisted into a grotesque form. They are one of the most common creatures around the ocean in EuropaCrawlers are relatively small and agile, and are one of the few creatures capable of entering the Submarine. They possess four pairs of red eyes, green skin, segmented spines on their back and multiple hand-like appendages, with only the frontal ones having a functionality, allowing them to latch on surfaces, swim and crawl (hence their name). Crawlers normally appear in small groups of 1-4 individuals, compensating their individual frailty, but they can be seen in large swarms of 8 or 15 individuals in specific Terminate a Swarm missions. See also Crawler Broodmother and Crawler Hatchling.
- Mudraptor: The Mudraptor is a creature from Europa resembling a grotesque mix between a dinosaur and a shrimp. They are the second most common creature after Crawlers. Mudraptors are agile creatures and are one of the few creatures capable of entering the Submarine. Mudraptors possess two strong legs which allow them to walk in a bipedal posture, and an extremely sharp beak capable of breaching a Submarine's hulls. They can easily kill Humans by mauling them to death. They have teal skin covered by many grey shells and tiny, almost vestigial hand-like appendages. See also Mudraptor Veteran and Mudraptor Hatchling
- Thresher: The Tiger Thresher is a ray-finned fish beast that lives within the oceans of Europa. Tiger Threshers are eel-like creatures that have leopard-like splotches towards the front of their body, and small stripes towards their tail (like a tiger). Their head is transparent and bioluminescent, like that of a barreleye fish. Like the head of the Tiger Thresher, their tail also glows, but not as brightly as their head. The spine of the Tiger Thresher has spiny protrusions that cover the majority of their back. Tiger Threshers do not have visible eyes, like most of the sea-life on Europa. Tiger Threshers are only found in swarms. See also Tiger Thresher Hatchling and Bone Thresher.
- Spineling: The Spineling is a small creature of impressive agility and marksmanship, and one of the only creatures with a ranged attack. The Spineling is small and spindly, appearing similar to a dark dragonfly thanks to its twelve metallic-white spines and scales on its rear, but is more so a fin-less eel, capable of twisting on the spot to get the best shot with its plethora of natural harpoons. See also Giant Spineling.

Large Creatures:
- Hammerhead: The Hammerhead is an uncommon creature found in the frigid oceans of Europa. Hammerheads are medium-size shark-like creatures. They have at least two pairs of eyes, four claws, four fins, and a long tail, which is their primary mode of locomotion. Their most distinctive feature is their flat head, which is reminiscent of the head of a claw hammer. Hammerheads are somewhat solitary creatures, but are sometimes seen in groups of up to five, though they typically come in groups of two to three. See also Golden Hammerhead and Hammerhead Spawn
- Moloch: The Moloch is a large jellyfish-like creature that manifests in Europa. Molochs' large dark blue shells cover most of their main bodies, also known as their 'core', to provide protection from their front. Moloch's cores are mostly made up of their 'ballast sac', which pulsates to allow movement underwater. Above the Moloch's core, three elongated dark brown tentacles protrude from under the shell. Below the core, thin black tendrils known as the 'skirt' trail the Moloch, providing extra protection. Molochs rely on echolocation to navigate. The sounds emitted from this are strikingly tuneful notes, which become stronger and higher in tone when the creature attacks. These will also cause interference on Sonar if they are close enough, and leads to Moloch being detected from a relatively long range in passive sonar, compared to other Creatures.
- Watcher: The Watcher is an enormous, orb-shaped creature reminiscent of a turtle or a crab. The Watcher consists of a jet-black main body of immense size that takes the shape of a sphere, and is surrounded by thick armor and protective spikes, giving it great resistance to almost all forms of damage, but this is balanced by its large, vulnerable eye. Named after said ominous red eye, the Watcher lacks any true method of attack, but does inflict many negative effects in the form of the affliction 'Watcher's Gaze' when investigating Submarines or Divers. Watchers are completely deaf, and rely entirely on their impressive sight to find objects of interest such as submarines or divers. Watchers are solitary and never found with one of its own. Watchers do not interact with other Watchers. However, they do tend to gather crowds of other creatures, such as Crawlers or Mudraptors.

Abyssal Creatures:
- Charybdis: The Charybdis body appears as a large mass of dark tentacles serving for navigation, and ending with a sharp point, reminiscent of a spear tip. Its teeth and massive tongue are crimson red. Humans will first see massive orange pings on the sonar that grow stronger the closer the Charybdis is to the submarine. The sonar silhouette of the Charybdis resembles a massive dolphin. The Charybdis can naturally be found in the Abyss.
- Endworm: The Endworm is a titanic, worm-like creature, named after its ability to 'end' the lives of anybody who comes across it. It is the largest and most destructive naturally encountered creature in Europa's ocean. The Endworm itself is a colossal behemoth, a serpent-like leviathan covered in an incredibly durable, stone-like armor shell. It is incredibly fast, aggressive, and durable enough to withstand nuclear ordnance, but still has certain vulnerabilities. Its presence is often preluded by its constant monstrous roaring, which is often visible on a submarine's sonar due to its intensity.
- Latcher: The Latcher is a creature which stalks Submarines from the shadows of the Abyss. It waits from a distance for an opportune moment to strike at its prey. The Latcher is a large creature which resides in the Abyss. It has several eyes which glow, revealing its position to anyone gazing through windows or a periscope. Its many teeth are used to consume smaller living beings, though it has been observed to feast on corpses lost to the depths. It has four legs which make its signature on the sonar easy to identify. Within the mouth of this creature hides an incredibly long tongue which can extend up to 45 meters. Once the tongue makes contact with a target, the Latcher will only let go if it feels threatened, wishes to attack from a new angle, or has eaten whatever it has caught.
